# Week 1 Day 1 — Bootstrap the Expense-Tracking Domain

A small domain model for tracking expenses: transactions with amounts,
dates, merchants, and categories; receipts attached to transactions; and
classifiers that infer category or kind from transaction data.

## Package layout

Root package: `com.uptimecrew.expense`

- `com.uptimecrew.expense.model` — domain entities and value objects
- `com.uptimecrew.expense.service` — domain services and classifiers

## Domain types

- `Transaction` — a single expense entry (amount, date, merchant, kind, category)
- `ExpenseCategory` — category assigned to a transaction
- `Receipt` — supporting document attached to a transaction
- `TransactionKind` — kind/type of a transaction
- `TransactionClassifier` — assigns a category to a transaction
- `MerchantNameClassifier` — infers category from the merchant name

## Build & test

Requires JDK 17+. Uses the Gradle wrapper.

- `./gradlew test` — run tests
- `./gradlew build` — compile and run tests
- `./gradlew test --tests "com.uptimecrew.expense.model.ExpenseTest"` — single test class

## Conventions

- Money: `java.math.BigDecimal` (scale 2, `HALF_UP`) — never `double`/`float`
- Identifiers: `String` — never numeric ID types
- Dates: `java.time.LocalDate` for calendar dates, `java.time.Instant` for timestamps
- Tests: JUnit 5 only

## Day 2

Adds a queryable transaction ledger using immutable collection snapshots, stream pipelines, Optional-based lookup, and parameterized JUnit 5 tests.

## Day 3

Adds multiple transaction-classification strategies, a factory for choosing them, constructor-injected classification service behavior, record-based model code, and Mockito-backed service tests.
